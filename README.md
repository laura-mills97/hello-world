Hello world! I am Laura. I am 26 years old and born and raised in Los Angeles, CA.  I currently work as a cost anaylst and am hoping to expand my knowledge and abilities with a Master's in Data Science.  Outside of work I love to hike and camp, paddleboard, snowboard, cook, and hang out with my friends.
